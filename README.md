## Dan Inventory System v1.0
  Welcome to the Dan Inventory System!
This is a simple inventory management system designed for testing backend functionality. In this version, we provide a dummy frontend that allows you to interact with the backend, performing operations such as => adding items
=> selling items
=> editing item details
=> deleting items. 
=>Additionally, we have a basic dashboard page to view key metrics.

# Dummy Frontend
The dummy frontend provides a basic user interface to interact with the backend. It includes forms for adding, selling, and editing items. The dashboard page displays key metrics.

## Note:
This version's frontend is minimal and primarily serves as a testing interface. A more polished and feature-rich frontend will be available in the next version.
